# Tweeter

##### LHL Twitter Clone Project

Tweeter is a single-page Twitter clone.

You are able to post new tweets using the compose tweets form ..but be careful! If you don't enter anything or if you go above the 140 character limit, you won't be able to post!

When you successfully create you tweet it will post it to the top of the tweet list along with a randomly generated name, handle and avatar.

You are also able to hide and show the compose tweet form using the compose new tweet button in the navigation bar. The button changes look when hovering with the mouse.

Finally you are able to highlight a tweet by hovering over with your mouse.

Enjoy!
